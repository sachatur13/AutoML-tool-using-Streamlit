# Modeling tool using Streamlit / Sklearn / Pandas / Autogluon

Creating a simple model analysis tool using 
- Streamlit framework as UI
- Scikit-learn for manual machine learning models
----- Classification

        Logistic Regression
        Random Forest

----- Regression

        Linear Regression
        Random Forest
        
The models are trained in default mode without any hyperparameter tuning.

- Data visualization using matplotlib.
- Data preprocessing using pandas.
- Autogluon for Automated model training and leaderboard.
- Model export as pickle file for manual trained models using sklearn.
- Predictive power score for feature importance using ppscore library.

To be added features - 
- Feature engineering for date features
- Add-on for formula based feature engineering
- Visualization size selector
